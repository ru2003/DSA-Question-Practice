//9. Implement Two Stacks in an Array
/*
 * Both stacks do not overflow unless the entire array is full.
They grow in opposite directions:

Stack 1 grows from left to right

Stack 2 grows from right to left

âœ… Real-Life Analogy
Imagine a single bookshelf ðŸ“š where:

Stack 1 keeps adding books from the left side

Stack 2 adds books from the right side

Both should stop when there is no space left in between
