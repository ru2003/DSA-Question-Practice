package LinkedList;
/*- Linked list is a {linear data} structure where elements , called nodes, are connected using pointers .
 * -unlike arrays, linked list do not store elements in contiguous memory locations.instead each node contains data and reference to the next node in the sequence.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * *******Advantages of Linked List*****
 * 1)dynamic size -linked lists can easiy grow or shrink in size by allocating or dellocating memory as needed.
 * 2)3efficient insertions/deletions--adding or removing nodes doesnt require shifting elemnts, as in arrays.
 * 3)memory utilization --memory is allocated only when required ,reducing wastage.
 * 
 * ************Disadvantages of Linked List******
 * 1)sequential access -> unlike arrays, linked lists do not allow direct access to elemnts via indices;traversal is necessary
 * 2)extra memory -> each node requires additional memory for the pointers
 * 3)complexity -> operations like reverse traversal or accessing previous nodes required more logic or a different list tupe.
 * 
 * linked list class ki jo object bante hai whi pure linked list hoti hain.
